\chapter{Noise2Fast}

Compared to Self2Self, Noise2Fast [10] accelerates self-supervised learning
by constructing training pairs using checkerboard downsampling from a single noisy input. This enables zero-shot
denoising in real-time without any prior knowledge of the noise distribution. % https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01666
