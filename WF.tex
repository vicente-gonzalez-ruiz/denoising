\chapter{Wiener Filtering (WF)}
%{{{

The Wiener filter \cite{wiener1942extrapolation} is an adaptive linear
filter designed to minimize the MSE between the denoised signal
$\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ and clean signal $\mathbf{x}$, when this has been
corrupted\footnote{A Wiener filter also considers that $\mathbf{x}$
  can be affected, apart from the noise, by some linear transformation
  (such as a blurring), but we will ingnore this.} by noise. For this
reason, WF is also known by \emph{minimum MSE filtering} and also by
\emph{least square error fitering}. When the filter is used only for
removing noise, we are refering to denoising.

To use WF, the next conditions must be satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The noise is not correlated with the original signal, i.e., the
  noise is ZAWG.
\item The mean of the noise is zero.
\item Signal and noise are stationary random processes (their mean and
  variance remains constant).
\end{enumerate}

Under these assumptions, WF minimizes the MSE between the output of
the filter $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ (the filtered signal) and the
(unknown) clean signal $\mathbf{x}$,
$\mathbb{E}\big((\tilde{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x})^2\big)$.  Because
$\mathbf{x}$ is seldom known, WF uses the statistics of
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ (the noisy signal) to minimize the error. It can be demonstrated \cite{wiener1942extrapolation} that the signal reconstruction provided by
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \text{IDFT}(\hat{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{W}),
  \label{eq:WF}
\end{equation}
minimizes such error, where $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ is the DFT of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$, and
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{W} = \frac{\text{PSD}(\hat{\mathbf{x}})}{\text{PSD}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) + \text{PSD}(\mathbf{n})}
  \label{eq:WF_frequency_response}
\end{equation}
is the frequency response of the Wiener filter (its transfer
function). If the noise is ZAWF (in general Gaussian), the PSD can be
approximated by the variance. Therefore,
Eq.~\ref{eq:WF_frequency_response} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{W}_k = \frac{\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{X}}_k)}{\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{X}}_k) + \sigma^2_{\mathbf{n}}},
  \label{eq:WF_coeffs}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{X}}_k)$ is the variance of the $k$-th
Fourier coefficient of the $\text{DFT}(\hat{\mathbf{x}})$ over a
collection of $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ instances, and
$\sigma^2_{\mathbf{n}}$ is (an estimation of) the variance of the
noise. For this reason, when we have only one instance of the signal,
the filter is performed by blocks. For example, the implementation
offered in Scipy
(\href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.wiener.html}{\texttt{scipy.signal.wiener}}),
which implements a local Wiener filter based on the use of windows,
requires two arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The window size $w$, which is the side of the (usually
  square\footnote{This implementation can work with multidimensional
    signals, and the shape of the window can be any, not only square
    (2D case) or cubic (3D case).}) window of pixels
  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]}$ (a window with side $w$
  centered\footnote{For this reason, $w$ must be odd.} at the $i$-th
  sample of the noisy signal).
\item The noise power, expressed as the average variance of the noise
  which is locally\footnote{Only in the case this parameter, the noise
    power, is not provided. If ${\sigma^2_{\mathbf{n}}}$ is known,
    this value is used for all the windows.} computed for the window
  centered at the $i$-th sample as
  \begin{equation}
    {\sigma^2_{\mathbf{n}}}=\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]})\right).
  \end{equation}
  If the GT signal were known, the noise power\footnote{Remember that
    the noise isuncorrelated with the GT signal, and therefore the
    power of the noise is the same in all the windows, on average.}
  could be estimated as
  \begin{equation}
    {\sigma^2}_{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbb{E}\big(\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}-\mathbf{x})\big).
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
Concretelly, the \texttt{scipy.signal.wiener} (\texttt{SSW} in short) implements
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \mathbb{E}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]}) + \dfrac{\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]})-\sigma^2_\mathbf{n}}{\mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]})}\left(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i-\mathbb{E}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]})\right) & : \ \mathbb{V}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]}) < \sigma^2_\mathbf{n} \\
      \mathbb{E}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{[i]}) & : \ \text{otherwise.}
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
In general, because $\sigma^2_{\mathbf{n}}$ is unknown, the denoising
process should be controlled using $w$ (the larger $w$, the greater
the filtering effect).

Alternatively, as Eq.~\ref{eq:WF} indicates, we can also denoise
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ in the frequency domain using as the transfer
function of the filter the $\text{SFC}(\hat{\mathbf{x}})$
\cite{verbeke2024self}. In this case,
Eq.~\ref{eq:WF_frequency_response} boils down to
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{W} = \text{SFC}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}).
  \label{eq:WF_SFC}
\end{equation}
This version of WF will be denoted by \texttt{WF(SFC)}.

\begin{comment}
If the GT were known, Eq.~\ref{eq:WF_SFC} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{W}(\mathbf{x}) = \text{SFC}(\mathbf{x}).
  \label{eq:WF_SFC*}
\end{equation}
We will refer to this filter as ``Wiener-SFC''.
