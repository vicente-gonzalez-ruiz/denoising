\chapter{BM3D}

BM3D [2] improves image quality by grouping similar patches into 3D
blocks, applying collaborative filtration via a transform domain
shrinkage and aggregating overlapping estimates to suppress noise
while preserving fine details.  However, BM3D is by design for
Gaussian noise and requires the user to input an estimate of the noise
standard deviation, a parameter to which BM3D is highly sensitive. % https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01666
