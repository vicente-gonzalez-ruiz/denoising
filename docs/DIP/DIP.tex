\chapter{Deep Image Prior (DIP)}

Deep Image Prior (DIP)[ 12 ] leverages the induction bias of a
randomly initialized convolutional neural network as an implicit image
prior. It enables denoising without external data by fitting the
network directly to the noisy image. However, DIP’s performance is
closely related to the number of iterations: too few iterations may
lead to underfitting to features, while too many iterations risk
overfitting to noise. % https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01666
