\chapter{Self2Self}

Blind zero-shot methods operate without requiring any prior
knowledge. Self2Self [13] denoises a single noisy image by training on
stochastic masked versions and averaging multiple stochastic
predictions. % https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01666

While its performance rivals that of the supervised methods, Self2Self introduces significant computational
overhead due to repeated inferences.
